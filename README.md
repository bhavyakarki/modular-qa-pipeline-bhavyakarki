HW 2 Description: Question Answering Pipeline with Learning
The dual purposes of this assignment are: a) to learn about the different modules in a Question Answering pipeline, including modules that are trained using machine learning, and b) to create a simple end-to-end QA system using a real training/test dataset. We will be using off-the-shelf tools to cover the two basic steps in component training: a) creating feature vectors (training instances) from the data set, and b) training and evaluating machine learning models on the data set (test instances).

The dataset for this assignment is Quasar-S. This dataset consists of 37,000 cloze-style questions, i.e these are fill in the blank style questions. The questions are built from definitions of software entity tags that are present in Stack Overflow, which is a community question answering platform. You will be training your model on the given training set and report the performance of the system on the development set.
